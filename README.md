## Laravel 8, Lighthouse(graphql), Voyager(admin), Cloudinary(Storage) 

I created this stack for those people who want to quickly develop their apps without spending too much time going through installation pains.
We all know that we can do way better w/ our precious time.
<br /><br />
I decided to include  <a href="https://cloudinary.com/">Cloudinary</a> for those people who are going to deploy on services, such as  <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and others, for image storage porpuses.(Heroku doesn‚Äôt support very well storage implementation)
